Elasticsearch Beyonder
======================

Welcome to the [Elasticsearch](http://www.elastic.co/) Beyonder project.

This project comes historically from [spring-elasticsearch](https://github.com/dadoonet/spring-elasticsearch) project.

Getting Started
===============

Maven dependency
----------------

Import elasticsearch-beyonder in you project `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>fr.pilato.elasticsearch</groupId>
  <artifactId>elasticsearch-beyonder</artifactId>
  <version>5.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you want to set a specific version of elasticsearch, add it to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.elasticsearch</groupId>
  <artifactId>elasticsearch</artifactId>
  <version>5.4.2</version>
</dependency>
```

Adding Beyonder to your client
------------------------------

For RestClient or TransportClient, you can define many properties to manage automatic creation
of index, mappings, templates and aliases.

To activate those features, you only need to call:

```java
ElasticsearchBeyonder.start(client);
```

By default, Beyonder will try to locate resources from `elasticsearch` directory within your classpath.
We will use this default value for the rest of the documentation.

But you can change this using:

```java
ElasticsearchBeyonder.start(client, "models/myelasticsearch");
```

In that case, Beyonder will search for resources from `models/myelasticsearch`.


## Using REST Client (recommended)

Elasticsearch now provides a [Rest Client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/5.4/index.html).
It's the recommended way as the Transport Client is now deprecated and will be removed in a next major version.

Just pass to Beyonder a Rest Client instance:

```java
RestClient client = RestClient.builder(new HttpHost("localhost", 9200, "http")).build();
ElasticsearchBeyonder.start(client);
```

## Using Transport Client (deprecated)

To use the deprecated TransportClient, just pass it to Beyonder:

```java
Client client = new PreBuiltTransportClient(Settings.EMPTY)
           .addTransportAddress(new InetSocketTransportAddress(new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", 9300)));
ElasticsearchBeyonder.start(client);
```

Managing indices
----------------

When Beyonder starts, it tries to find index names and settings in the classpath.

If you add in your classpath a file named `elasticsearch/twitter`, the `twitter` index will be automatically created
at startup if it does not exist yet.

If you add in your classpath a file named `elasticsearch/twitter/_settings.json`, it will be automatically applied to define
settings for your `twitter` index.

For example, create the following file `src/main/resources/elasticsearch/twitter/_settings.json` in your project:

```javascript
{
  "index" : {
    "number_of_shards" : 3,
    "number_of_replicas" : 2
  }
}
```

Managing types
--------------

If you define a file named `elasticsearch/twitter/tweet.json`, it will be automatically applied as the mapping for
the `tweet` type in the `twitter` index.

For example, create the following file `src/main/resources/elasticsearch/twitter/tweet.json` in your project:

```javascript
{
  "tweet" : {
    "properties" : {
      "message" : {"type" : "string", "store" : "yes"}
    }
  }
}
```

Managing templates
------------------

Sometimes it's useful to define a template mapping that will automatically be applied to new indices created. 

For example, if you planned to have indexes per year for twitter feeds (twitter2012, twitter2013, twitter2014) and you want
to define a template named `twitter_template`, you can add a file named `elasticsearch/_template/twitter_template.json`
in your project:

```javascript
{
    "template" : "twitter*",
    "settings" : {
        "number_of_shards" : 1
    },
    "mappings" : {
        "tweet" : {
            "properties" : {
                "message" : {
                    "type" : "string",
                    "store" : "yes"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


Why this name?
==============

I was actually looking for a cool name in the marvel characters list and found
that [Beyonder](http://marvel.wikia.com/Beyonder_(Earth-616)) was actually a very
powerful character.

This project gives some features beyond elasticsearch itself. :)
